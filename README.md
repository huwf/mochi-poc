# Mochi POC

This repo is intended to be a place where I experiment with different frameworks in JavaScript
and Python, in order to implement a web application.

For the backend, I plan to use:
* Flask
* FastAPI
* Django

For the frontend, I plan to use:
* Vue
* ReactJS

## Overall goals
* Get a stable web application with tests using different frameworks
* Experiment with scalability trade-offs, and implement
* Have proper front-end and backend authentication
* Maybe use Terraform to deploy to AWS?
