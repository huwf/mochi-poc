# Mochi POC

Mochi is a web application which uses flashcards. It is like anki, except has an API.
I plan to keep using the flashcards and web application, but locally I will integrate this into
my own pipelines, e.g from other learning resources so that I can do everything in one place.

For this repo in general, however, I care mainly about experimenting with different frameworks in JavaScript
and Python, in order to implement a web application.

For the backend, I plan to try out the following frameworks:
* Flask
* FastAPI
* Django

For the frontend, I plan to use:
* Vue
* ReactJS

I also plan to try and setup some deployment scripts for different cloud providers or local development.

## Overall goals
* Get a stable web application with tests using different frameworks
* Experiment with scalability trade-offs, and implement
* Have proper front-end and backend authentication
* Maybe use Terraform to deploy to AWS?
